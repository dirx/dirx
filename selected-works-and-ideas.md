Some selected works and ideas that have emerged over the years.

# 2022

## Moving Blocks Mono

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirx/fxhash-creations/mono/resources/moving-blocks/orange-3circlesand2quads-3-2584--21%C2%B0-1597-left%2Cleft-up%2Cright-down-negative-1-31947444-ootn2iTgutBGJMq2hSBWbA8kEJS54cGWWhbH1Ttx4MepLY7F4j4.png)

Several shapes form boundaries. Within these boundaries, the moving blocks move pixels and rotate their color values from a specific color to black. Each shape has its own direction vector, which affects the feature-based directions and speed of the moving blocks.

My second animated genart published on the tezos based platform [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/moving-blocks-mono).

[Source code](https://github.com/dirx/fxhash-creations/tree/mono) is available on github.

## Zebra

![](/assets/2022-zebra.png)

My first coded art published on the tezos based platform [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/zebra).

Zebra follows a simple idea: shifting pixel blocks up, down, right or left and rotating color values according to different rules.

The animation uses the fast deterministic prng xorshift128. This allows it to be played repeatedly in the same sequence. 
Width, height and pixel ratio change the sequence of the animation.

[Source code](https://github.com/dirx/fxhash-creations/tree/zebra) is available on github.

# 2016

# 2010

## tschk! talks

![](/assets/2010-tschk-talks.png)

Proud supporter of [tschk!talks](https://tschk.de/) - a forum for talks by friends for friends, often in the form of two short talks, conversations, drinks and music in Berlin Kreuzberg. The talks were initiated by my friends Mac & Tons. The last tschk!talks event was at the end of 2017.

My part: Logo design and running the blog.

## wahl11.de

![](/assets/2010-wahl11.png)

wahl11.de is an art project by [Rigoletti aka Marion Pfaus](https://rigoletti.de/), supported by Martin Wieser.

On wahl11.de you can vote democratically for the German national soccer team. Of course, until further notice, the national coach will name the lineup of the team, but we vote anyway. Finally, all 80 million coaches in Germany get a turn!

My part: coding with yii and having fun with twitter bots.

# 2007

## Font Parole

![](/assets/2007-font-parole-schablonen.png)
![](/assets/2007-font-parole.png)

The typeface with the stencils of the German cabinet (plus some *goodies*) was created after a short exchange with Jürgen Siebert from [Fontblog](https://www.fontblog.de/) / FontShop and with the active support of Axel Mattern (OTF & Cleanup) based on the DIN Schablonierschrift created by Marian Steinbach.
I contributed the stencils.

See [dataloo blog post](https://dataloo.de/parole-font-carepaket-fur-den-politischen-widerstand-537.html) for more details and the [download](http://www.dataloo.de/wp-content/uploads/parole.zip).

It was used in 2009 for banners & images with the claim ["Zensursula"](https://netzpolitik.org/2009/kommentierte-zensursula-linkliste/) during protests against a law to block websites.

## Aktion Überwach!

![](/assets/2007-aktion-uberwach.jpeg)

The idea behind [Aktion Überwach!](https://uberwach.de/): use a tracking pixel to collect data and publicly document which federal and state ministries, government and opposition parties have accessed which participating websites.

Almost 1,000 websites had participated in the project by its end in 2018. Around 170,000 hits from federal and state ministries and from government and opposition parties were documented.

## Stasi 2.0 Schäublone

![](/assets/2007-stasi20-schablone.svg)
{: .pt-6 }

A spray stencil. It helped draw more attention to the protests against the planned data retention laws.

With the support of [Spreadshirt](https://www.spreadshirt.de/), T-shirt sales raised more than 10,000 EUR in donations for the Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung, which helped organize the protests.

Nowadays it can also be found in the [German wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi_2.0).

## dataloo.de

![](/assets/2005-dataloo.gif)

Started [blogging about stuff](https://dataloo.de) in tandem with my old buddy [Mac](https://www.instagram.com/dataloo/). Sorry: only in German.
We stopped blogging regularly around 2012 - with some erratic and not really successful comeback attempts since then.

At some point we were among the top 30 in the German blog scene - at least for a few months.

## Radio Strandgut

![](/assets/2000-radio-strandgut.jpg)

Radio Strandgut is the successor of Radio Hijackin', which I ran regularly with my friends Mike and Mac during our studies at Furtwangen University in 1997. Strandgut was the name of the program part that Mac contributed to the show back then.

Online radio, 2 shows, audio streaming via SHOUTcast server on Linux. It was not recorded only broadcasted.

My part: jingles production, running the website & hosting the show together with my buddy Mac.

We were supported by Martin Wieser with office space & equipment and by 9teen with server hosting.
