👋 Hi, my name is Dirk Adler.

⚒️ I work at [idealo](https://jobs.idealo.com/l/en/uber-uns) as a team lead in the product & technology department. idealo is one of the leading price comparison platforms in Germany and
other European countries. And in case you're wondering, it's not a startup anymore - idealo has about 1000 employees.

🪛 I'm [klitsche.de](https://klitsche.de/) when I'm programming for my own clients.

🥏 I sell limited edition frisbees with my own design at [wurfscheibe.de](https://wurfscheibe.de/). Sorry: __sold out!__

✒️ I used to write about random stuff on [dataloo](https://dataloo.de/) when blogging was still a thing. By the way, dataloo has its own [font](https://dataloo.de/der-dataloo-font).

✨ I contribute to [open source projects](https://dirx.dev/open-source-projects/).

🎨 If you're curious, you can take a look at some [artworks and projects](https://dirx.dev/artworks-and-projects/) I've played around with or simply supported over the years.
